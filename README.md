kitaev_periodic.py is the source code with functions that computes the eigenstates of the Kitaev model for a given vison configuration.

kitaev_h.py is the source file that does the same as above but for a finite value of time reversal breaking Majorana mass term.

working.py calculates the matrix element of a Zeeman field between two nearest neighbor vison positions.
